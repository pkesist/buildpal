Bugs and caveats
================

* Debug symbols/PDB files/precompiled headers.
    It is difficult to handle PDB file generation when distributing build.
    PDB format is closed and there is no known way to merge two PDB files into a
    single one. In other words, if two objects are compiled on different
    servers, ``BuildPal`` cannot create a single PDB containing debug info for
    both objects.

    BuildPal currently avoids the issue by replacing any ``/Zi`` compiler
    switches it detects with ``/Z7``, i.e. debug info gets stored in the object
    file itself. This is also done for precompiled headers. Of course, ``/Zi``
    and ``/Z7`` precompiled headers are incompatible. Consequently, if you build
    your PCH with ``/Zi``:
    
    * PCH files must be generated via BuildPal.
    * PCH files generated by BuildPal will not work when used in a regular local
      compilation - you'll get a compiler error.

* Header cache and volatile search path
    Cache assumes that a fixed search path and header name will always
    resolve to the same file. If you place a new header file in a directory
    on include path before the pre-existing header file with the same name,
    it is possible that the pre-existing header will still be used.
